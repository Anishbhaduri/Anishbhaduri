### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Anishbhaduri/Anishbhaduri** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on hackathons & open source projects! Will be venturing into other ways of contributing soon!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things at once, to be honest. I love to learn, and that is quite apparent with all the repositories and work you may see here.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects- am quite new to it and am still learning some new tech stack, but am willing to get my hands dirty on this stuff!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with a few occasional problems, which I generally look up to google to resolve XD
- 💬 Ask me about almost anything! I love meeting new peeps & connecting with them while resolving conflicts!
- 📫 How to reach me: Through Linkedin.
- 😄 Pronouns:  I dont really care much-use whatever you like!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am quite lazier than what I seem to be xD..

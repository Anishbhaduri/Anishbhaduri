### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Anishbhaduri/Anishbhaduri** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on hackathons & open source projects! Will be venturing into other ways of contributing soon!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things at once, to be honest. I love to learn, and that is quite apparent with all the repositories and work you may see here.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects- am quite new to it and am still learning some new tech stack, but am willing to get my hands dirty on this stuff!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a few occasional problems, which I generally look up to google to resolve XD
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about almost anything! I love meeting new peeps & connecting with them while resolving conflicts!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Through Linkedin.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns:  I dont really care much-use whatever you like!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am quite lazier than what I seem to be xD..
